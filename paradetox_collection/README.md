# Parallel Text Detoxification Dataset Collection Instructions

For each language, we collected parallel text detoxification pairs with toxic<->non-toxic pairs. To do so, domain experts and native speakers were asked to perform paraphrasing. Then, the quality control was cross-cheked together with experts. Mainly, the annotation process was like these steps:

**Task 1: Generation of Paraphrases**: The first task asks users to eliminate toxicity in a given sentence while keeping the content.

**Task 2: Content Preservation Check**: We checked the generated paraphrases along with their original variants indicating if they have close meanings.

**Task 3: Toxicity Check**: Finally, we check if the annotators succeeded in removing toxicity.

For all new languages, we, firstly, provided the English instruction. For Chinese and Amharic, the experts adapted the instruction for their language. For Hindi and Arabic, the experts and native speakers oriented on the English instructions.

For more details about annotators demographic and other details, please, refer to our manuscript.
